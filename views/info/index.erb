My name is Rune Skjoldborg Madsen. I was born in 1983 in a small town a little north of Copenhagen, Denmark. Things were different back then. Our household technology consisted of a landline phone, a TV, and an electronic calculator. From one day to the next this changed drastically with the arrival of the computer, and like many other kids, my brother and I were intuitively drawn to it. We learned the buttons on the keyboard by playing digger. We learned our first english words playing Monkey Island 1. Then along came the internet, and that tiny computer in our living rooms became a portal to the rest of the world.

If I had been born 10 years before, my interest for visual form would probably have led me to the field of print design. Instead my first experience with graphic design was purely computational. I was writing HTML tags instead of drawing things on paper.

At the time, the simplest way of being creative on a computer was by building websites, so I became really good at this. Unfortunately, the only place to make money of building websites was in advertising, so this became my first career... and I hated it. I hated the hierarchy. I hated the people. I hated the way they treated programmers, by letting them implement the art directors PSD files. I couldn't care less about optimizing sales for Coca Cola.

My biggest problem with advertising was that everything was about the tool. The best designer was the person who could apply the nicest drop shadows or grayish gradients. Design was the thing that happened when you made your typography big. The computer was just a tool for speeding up things, and it proved so powerful that no one ever learned to think about design. Learning Photoshop was difficult enough by itself, and no one understood that technology is nothing in itself.

So I quit advertising and moved to New York to start graduate studies at the Interactive Telecommunications Program - a program focused on the intersection between technology and art. My first class at ITP was called Visualizing Data and it was taught by Stewart Smith. I absolutely loved everything about Stewart's work, and during that semester I slowly realized that it's possible to be an artist and a programmer at the same time. My two years at ITP was a journey away from the trendy and hip world of advertising and towards an understanding of what it actually means to use the computer as a creative tool.

When I call myself a computational designer, it's not because I'm a Photoshop expert who learned a little HTML, or a programmer who learned to apply drop shadows in illustrator. I call myself a computational designer because graphic design and programming are 2 native languages that I speak. I could as easily participate in a conversation about Bauhaus style, typefaces or shape balance, than I could participate in a conversation about programmatic patterns, OPENGL or the internals of Git. This is important to me because I see no distinction between the two. In most places the graphic designer is the "creative" and the programmer is the "technical", but I think this will soon be a very old world thing.

I believe that even the most basic things about design are misunderstood in the digital world. People rarely think about the medium they are designing for. If the form is the computer, you need to know about the computer



.. pixel stuff from slides ...

Stop when slides come to my own work. Talk more general about how I approach designing for and with the computer.













Someone once said that "Computer arts has a history but lacks a memory", and I find this very true. People celebrate the great field of data visualization, but forget that it has a long and solid history in the graphic arts.






.. whether or not these hip and trendy designs actually was the best possible form for the content.
=> honestly made me doubt if I wanted to be a graphic designer

I see many of these mistakes being repeated in the hip world of “data visualization” at the moment
It’s all about smooth colors and copying the latest trends.
This data viz has become the ultimate example of this world
All color and pretty => NO THINKING ABOUT CONTENT
It’s pretty clear => designers who think they invented their profession.

In simple examples people tend to get it 
=> Which design is best for the content DANGER?
.. but...

As soon as it’s design for a screen => People STOP THINKING
=> Go for trends
I was sick of this in advertising => Quit my job
Wanted to take a graduate degree => options in denmark were so hands-off
=> decided to look at international graduate schools
