<p>My name is Rune Skjoldborg Madsen. I was born in 1983 in a small town a little north of Copenhagen, Denmark. Things were different back then. Our household technology consisted of a landline phone, a TV, and an electronic calculator. From one day to the next this changed drastically with the arrival of the computer, and like many other kids, my brother and I were intuitively drawn to it. We learned the buttons on the keyboard by playing digger. We learned our first english words playing Monkey Island 1. Then along came the internet, and that tiny computer in our living rooms became a portal to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>If I had been born 10 years before, my interest for visual form would probably have led me to the field of print design. Instead my first experience with graphic design was purely computational. I was writing HTML tags instead of drawing things on paper.</p>

<p>At the time, the simplest way of being creative on a computer was by building websites, so I became really good at this. Unfortunately, the only place to make money of building websites was in advertising, so this was my first job... and I hated it. I hated the hierarchy. I hated the people. I hated the way they treated programmers, by letting them implement the art directors PSD files. I couldn't care less about optimizing sales for Coca Cola.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with advertising was that everything was about the tool. The best designer was the person who could apply the nicest drop shadows or grayish gradients. Design was the thing that happened when you made your typography big. The computer was such a powerful tool that the software ended up dictating the entire process. No one understood that technology is nothing in itself, so no one ever learned to *think* about design.</p>

<p>I quit advertising and moved to New York to start graduate studies at the Interactive Telecommunications Program, a program focused on the intersection between technology and art. During my first semester I slowly realized that it's possible to be an artist and a programmer at the same time. My two years at ITP was a journey towards an understanding of what it actually means to use the computer as a creative tool.</p>

<p>When I call myself a computational designer, it's not because I'm a Photoshop expert who learned a little HTML, or a programmer who learned to use the pen tool in illustrator. It's because graphic design and programming are 2 native languages that I speak. I could as easily participate in a conversation about Bauhaus color theory, typefaces or the history of grid systems, as I could participate in a conversation about functional programming, Ruby or the internals of Git. This is important to me because I see no clear distinction between these two fields.</p>

<p>I've worked at the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR), had my own design agency in Denmark, and for the New York Times as an interactive developer. I now spend most of my time working for O'Reilly Media, teaching a graduate class at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University, or making art with computers.</p>
