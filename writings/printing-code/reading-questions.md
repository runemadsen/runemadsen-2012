A few things to take away from these texts ...

Form + Content by Paul Rand
---------------------------

* 10 points to the person who knows who Paul Rand is
* Graphic design is not advertising
* Design is combining form and content. We need both. Too much form becomes abstract. Too much content becomes unreadable
* Design does not start with: "This is pretty". It starts with an onion of content that you peel
* Design is like ingredients. You cannot put a massive amount of one ingredient in a dish. But you cannot put all of them in either. It's a constant balance of making the complex simple.
* You cannot have content without form (this of typefaces), so we better design it well.
* In art there is no proof, only interpretation


Computers, Pencils, and Brushes by Paul Rand
--------------------------------------------

* The main thing to take away from this text is that rock stars, even prophets, can be wrong. Learn to trust your gut, but be ready to back it up.
* It's exactly this separation of "creative" and "technologist" that is killing design agencies
* However, don't do stuff just because the computer can do it
* Beware of trends
* Often it all starts in the head


Conversations With Paul Rand
----------------------------

The reason why I assigned this text is because it gives a good description of how important the manipulation of form is in graphic design, and the problems that arise from it. It's all about relationships. Form and content.

* What does Rand mean with "design is relationships"
* Name a specific example of a relationship from your assignment this week?
* Did any of you treat that relationship in code? Dynamically?
* Rand talks about decoration vs. design. What does he mean?

* Is there anything Paul Rand says that relates to code and algorithms?
* Find specific passages and ask: If you should, how would you code this?


Hackers and Painters by Paul Graham
----------------------------------

* Good description of being an implementor vs. a creative programmer. Many companies think like this
* Do you understand the concept of a static vs. dynamic programming language?
* I love the story about DaVinci painting the leaves. He was relentless. The unseen matters! Great software makes great products.
* Programs are for humans to read


Design and the Play Instinct by Paul Rand
------------------------------------------

* Now you know why I give constraints in assignments
* Think about this in your Olivetti assignment. What was the designer trying to communicate? Investigate!
* Modulor! Le Corbusier was crazy, but it's an interesting way of contraining your own work
* The last pages have a great catalog of different way of constraining your work. It can be the source of many, many projects.
