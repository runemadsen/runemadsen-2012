A few things to take away from these texts ...

Form + Content by Paul Rand
---------------------------

* Graphic design is not advertising
* Design is combining form and content. We need both. Too much form becomes abstract. Too much content becomes unreadable
* Design does not start with: "This is pretty". It starts with an onion of content that you peel
* Design is like ingredients. You cannot put a massive amount of one ingredient in a dish. But you cannot put all of them in either. It's a constant balance of making the complex simple.
* You cannot have content without form (this of typefaces), so we better design it well.
* In art there is no proof, only interpretation


Computers, Pencils, and Brushes by Paul Rand
--------------------------------------------

* The main thing to take away from this text is that rock stars, even prophets, can be wrong. Learn to trust your gut, but be ready to back it up.
* It's exactly this separation of "creative" and "technologist" that is killing design agencies
* However, don't do stuff just because the computer can do it
* Beware of trends
* Often it all starts in the head
