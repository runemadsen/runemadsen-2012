Printing Code
=============

THESE WEEKLY LECTURES ARE NOT GRAPHIC DESIGN HISTORY, LIKE THE FIRST CLASS. THESE ARE HANDS ON EXAMPLES AND EXERCISES - LIKE IN GRAPHIC DESIGN BOOKS - AND I ONLY SHOW WORK TO EMPHASIS THE LEARNINGS.

Class: Form
----------------------

Readings
John Maeda - Design By Numbers, Chapter 1
Paul Graham - Hackers and Painters
Paul Rand: Something from Design, Form and Chaos
DDD4: CorporateIDMaker (ironic) - goes to the nerve of it: design can never be done by a program, but you can speak through code

Assignment
Like the rubik’s cube. Maybe they have to print out the shapes and frame, and then organize them and bring them to class.

Discussion
Talk about form readings

Lecture:

DE, form chapter. Take points from that. 
DE, p. 32: Show rectangle and circle, show dirty and clean
DE, p. 36: Talk about proportion and sizes
DE, p. 37: Talk about positives and negatives / contrast
DE, p. 38: I STOPPED HERE. READ FROM HERE. 
Show rectangles from “Design Elements” book’s chapter about form
Take stuff from Paul Rand book, talking about graphic design education
Show examples of form in graphic design (Paul rand, etc)
Show examples of form in generative design (from GG and other books) 
Talk about relationships
What can form do? Show image of grayscale skyline. Show [Yoni’s double skyline](http://www.streetarttlvnyc.com/images/logo_pict.png).

Then go through form in Processing: ellipse, rect, so on.
Then explain beginShape and vertices. How to create forms in Processing
Show cool examples of sketches from GG (should be in class repo) that creates form

Readings for this class

Assignment
Place, scale and order specific forms. I give them source code, they tweak variables. Only grayscale. No alpha. 

Class: Color
----------------------

Use this:
http://itp.nyu.edu/classes/ahsl-fall2010/category/readings/final-projects/combiing-color/

One class about color theory. We go through combining color and schemes. Assignment is to create a sketch that generates a color scheme and prints it.
Programming assignment: Make the gradient class
Albers, Itten

Start with RGB, then explain HSB (all from Processing)
Then start including color theory and work examples, but everything should be based in Processing

Class: Grids
----------------------

Use grid system text from Form and Code, p. 101.
This class should start with explanation of grids and then move on to talk about how to make this algorithmic and mess it up.
Talk about gerstners [flexible grid](http://www.aisleone.net/2010/design/celebrating-karl-gerstner/) from “designing programmes”

Class: Typography
----------------------

Use p. 113 in Form and Code
Show examples from “Creative Code” p. 86, 93.
Show examples from Generative Gestaltung
Read: Paul Rand from p. 149
Read: Something from Bringhurst (one could be p. 25)
Talk about [Greta and](http://www.typotheque.com/blog/greta_system) and the [blog post](http://www.typotheque.com/articles/designing_type_systems)
THIS IS GREAT: http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3183-the-art-of-computer-typography. Use it with bulletins from the serving library that uses his font. Show how to draw a font in vectors...
THERE A BOOK CALLED [TYPE + CODE](http://www.issuu.com/jpagecorrigan/docs/type-code_yeohyun-ahn). It’s only about creating generative typography with processing.
Bringhurst for the web: http://www.webtypography.net/toc/

Class: Transformation
----------------------

Use chapter from Form and Code
- Image filters
Show examples of Adam Harvey’s spam art.
Assignment: Create a photo filter
Use the 8-bit photo filter as an assignment: Teaches them to think about bits and bytes.

Class: Repetition
----------------------

Use stuff from “Repetition” from Form and Code.
Use Arabic Patterns?
- Patterns
Talk about [these patterns](http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/andy-gilmore-2)
Talk about [this grapefruit](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3pk0fpD471r0i205o1_1280.jpg)
- Recursion
Use examples from graphic design history. Go through examples and projects

Class: Motion
----------------------

Use “Simulate” chapter in Form and Code: Swarms, Genetic Algorithms, particles, so on.
Find examples from graphic design that shows movement.

Class: Randomization
----------------------

Generative Form
Noise

Class: 3D
----------------------

Class: Logo
----------------------

I like this because a logo is everything about graphic design condensed into one thing.
Show work like the Tisch Gala logo and the MIT logo + stuff like

Possible assignments
----------------------

About the assignments: Everything is possible on the computer. Constraints are everything. So it’s up to you to set up rules for yourself. Many of the assignments have built-in rules.

Possible first assignment: Draw something in hand that would be better drawn in code...
Possible first assignment: Give a vague, confusing assignment
Possible first assignment: Bring in four images of artworks 1) A work that you like and is good 2) A work that you don’t like and don’t think is good 3) A work that you like but suspect might not be good 4) A work that you don’t like but have to admit is good

Recreate a well-known poster in Processing. Tweak the variables to change the appearance.

Find a graphic design poster that you like and bring it to class.

Make a sketch that generates very different outputs. Print the 2 best ones

Make sketch that runs an animation. Make it choose a time to take a snapshot. Print out the 2 best ones.

Make a photo filter. Write an algorithm that analyzes the pixels of an image and transforms it.

Midterm: Create your own font. Show examples from “Creative Code” and GG

Setting up rules and constraints

Something about randomization

Create a stencil on the laser cutter and create a poster with it.

The Five Obstructions assignment. I give students 5 obstructions to understand constraints.

Do one of repetition, inspired by Paul Rands text

Print a quote - design and style it

Make a sketch where you control the variables via a GUI. Make something interesting and print it.

Maybe this is an assignment: Encode data into an image. Like the waveform in the hidden parts of the image, or the stewart smith assignment.

Make a program that places forms on a page according to some rule of propportion (DDD4 p, 14)

Notes that I need to put somewhere

Use Gerstner. He also had mathematical paintings, and his design career had the same approach

Use gerstners “programme” idea (p. 8 dot dot dot 4)

Judith Williamson - find texts

Use rules from Design Elements in first class talk, or later?
Beautiful graphics read like they weren’t designed.
