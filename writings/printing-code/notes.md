Possible assignments
----------------------

About the assignments: Everything is possible on the computer. Constraints are everything. So it’s up to you to set up rules for yourself. Many of the assignments have built-in rules.

Possible first assignment: Draw something in hand that would be better drawn in code...
Possible first assignment: Give a vague, confusing assignment

Recreate a well-known poster in Processing. Tweak the variables to change the appearance.

Find a graphic design poster that you like and bring it to class.

Make a sketch that generates very different outputs. Print the 2 best ones

Make sketch that runs an animation. Make it choose a time to take a snapshot. Print out the 2 best ones.

Make a photo filter. Write an algorithm that analyzes the pixels of an image and transforms it.

Midterm: Create your own font. Show examples from “Creative Code” and GG

Setting up rules and constraints

Something about randomization

Create a stencil on the laser cutter and create a poster with it.

The Five Obstructions assignment. I give students 5 obstructions to understand constraints.

Do one of repetition, inspired by Paul Rands text

Print a quote - design and style it

Make a sketch where you control the variables via a GUI. Make something interesting and print it.

Maybe this is an assignment: Encode data into an image. Like the waveform in the hidden parts of the image, or the stewart smith assignment.

Make a program that places forms on a page according to some rule of proportion (DDD4 p, 14)
