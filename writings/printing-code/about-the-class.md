About the Class
---------------

* How it started: Tiny Artists
* Not Advertising, but Graphic Arts
* About the word _generative_
** Not so much interest in making complicated things as we are in using the computer to simplify.
* Think! "Write the truest sentence you've ever written" - Hemingway. That's the aim. We could add "simplest" to that. That's why Paul Rand is great. You cannot change anything.
* Constraints in assignments in the beginning
