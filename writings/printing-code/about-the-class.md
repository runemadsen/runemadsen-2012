About the Class
---------------

* How it started: Tiny Artists
* Not Advertising, but Graphic Arts
* About the word _generative_
* Think! "Write the truest sentence you've ever written" - Hemingway. That's the aim. We could add "simplest" to that. That's why Paul Rand is great. You cannot change anything.
* Constraints in assignments in the beginning

A Few Things
------------

* Do a git repository for your code! Send me an email with it.
* We present code and product
* Don't just take my examples and change a few things
* No laptops
* _Design by committee_ is terrible. Only groups allowed for mid-terms and finals
* Go to AMS together! (visit next week)
