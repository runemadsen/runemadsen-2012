About the Class
---------------

* Welcome. First of all, this is printing code, give people time to leave
* First time it runs, happy to see so much interest
* Today 3 things...
    1. Talking about the class / syllabus walkthrough
    2. Introductions
    3. Me talking a lot
* About Printing Code
    * I started thinking about this class: Almost all Graphic Design is computational
    * People are still doing it by hand
    * How would automatic graphic design software look like?
    * Tiny artists
    * Not advertising, but graphic arts
    * Not necessarily generative, but applying real graphic design theory to code
* Explain goal: Hemingway: "Write the truest sentence you've ever written"
* What you realize: You can't change anything of the great masters
* Assignment constraints
