About the Class

* Advertising vs. Graphic Arts
* About the word _generative_
* Class [introduction](#introduction)
* Ultimately about forcing you to **think** about even the simplest forms of graphic communication
* These lectures are based on my way of approaching a task as a designer (first form, then color)
* Constraints in assignments in the beginning
* "Write the truest sentence you've ever written" - Hemingway. That's the aim. We could add "simplest" to that. That's why Paul Rand is great. You cannot change anything.

Things To Keep In Mind
----------------------

**Printing Code** is a class where we will be working in the intersection between programming and graphic design. This means that you will need to bring both a desire to work hard on the programming assignments, and an interest in leading the in-class discussions around the weekly readings. Here’s a few things to keep in mind: 

* This is a class where we present both code and product, and during presentations you will have to account for the code that produced your visual. Hopefully this will teach you a ton about programming, make you write clean code, and keep the “copy / paste / tweak” mentality away.

* You will not need to have your laptops open in this class, as I will post slides and example code on this website after every class. If you do wish to take notes on your laptop, please let me know.

* _Design by committee_ is a terrible thing, and therefore most assignments will be individual. Groups are allowed during mid-terms and finals.

* That being said, you are encouraged to share paper and AMS reservations with at least one other person. The print reservations at AMS fill up quickly, and it's much better to go in groups of 2 or 3 people.

* Please participate. I will try to give my honest opinion, and you should try your best to give me yours. This also means actually doing the readings.

* In this class I highly encourage you to take on the role as an artist and independent thinker. You will need to find a delicate balance between thought and tool. Building your own tools is great (and highly encouraged), but please don't surrender to technology just because you can. You are in control, and your thought processes should guide your designs.
