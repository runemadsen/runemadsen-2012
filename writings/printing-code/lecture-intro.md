The History of Graphic Design and Computational Form
====================================================

Graphic design is a relatively young way of expression, primarily a response to the communication needs of the industrial revolution. 

Early Renaissance
-----------------

Since the invention of movable type in the early 1400's, book design was a craft primarily focused on readability. Typography was neutral, and headings were very rare. Images were used sparingly and mostly for iconic purposes. A book was merely a medium for communicating spoken words. 


William Addison Dwiggins
------------------------

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dwiggins_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dwiggins.jpg" />

The invention of the term _Graphic Design_ has been attributed to William Addison Dwiggins, director of the Harvard University Press and founder of the Society of Calligraphers in Boston. Born in 1880 at the exact time of the invention of the Linotype machine, Dwiggins coined this term in 1922 to describe his process of designing books, as combination of typesetting, illustration and design. Book design changed from being a simple, neutral craft to a interpretive art:

<blockquote data-slideshow="self">
What type does the architect of advertising elect to use, and why? That question is the acolyte’s invariable first prayer for enlightenment—phrased always in one of the various voices of despair—what type shall I use? The gods refuse an answer. They refuse (sacrilege though it be to say it) because they do not know.
</blockquote>

This - one of many book covers designed by Dwiggins - underlines this new way of thinking: That _seeing_ is as important as _reading_, and that typography and illustration can be used for symbolism. Dwiggins worked most of his life in advertising, and released the book _Layout in Advertising_ in 1928.


Futurists, Dadaists and De Stijl
--------------------------------

At the same time in the early 20th century quite a few artistic movements started rejecting the former divide between high art and every day design. The most important of these were the Futurists, Dadaists and De Stijl. With these movements came a very strong reinvention of graphic form.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/depero_futurista_cover_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/depero_futurista_cover.jpg" />

With the **Futurist Manifesto**, a number of Italian artists swore off the traditional arts, and instead sought to visualize the future, technology and the industrial revolution through the lens of most artistic expressions. In the graphic arts this meant experiments in typography, geometric forms and color. 

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/futurismo_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/futurismo.jpg" />

The futurist movement had strong ties to Fascism and Mussolini, which meant a further popularization of the futurist art through newspaper and poster design. 

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dada_show_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dada_show.jpg" />

**Dadaism** was an art movement that started as a reaction to the first world war. They borrowed heavily from the experimental typography of the Futurists, although their style was more surreal. They rebelled against any logic in the arts, to the degree that their work can seem almost post-modern today. In the graphic arts they combined expressive typography and extreme use of white-space with the heavy use of photo montages. The typeface itself held as much symbolism as the words it spelled out. Here it is a poster for the international Dadaist show in 1921.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dada_blume_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dada_blume.jpg" />

Here it's the cover for Kurt Schwitters "Anna Blume" from 1919.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/mondrian_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/mondrian.jpg" />

**De Stijl**, or _The Style_ in Dutch, was an abstract art movement formed in the Netherlands. With its strict minimalism, De Stijl artists kept to a bare minimum of expression, rarely using anything other than straight lines and primary colors. Here it is the famous painter Piet Mondrian, one of the leading figures in the De Stijl movement.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/destijl_logo_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/destijl_logo.jpg" />

The important thing to notice, here with the original logo for the De Stijl publication, is the almost algorithmic use of form and proportion. It's a use of form and color that points towards the later works of Sol Lewitt, and even the early experiments in computational art.

All in all these movements made a drastic impact on the way typography, form and color was used in publications. It further diminished the former distinction between _high art_ and print design, and all three of these movements had a great impact on the teachings at the Bauhaus.


The Bauhaus
-----------


<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus.jpg" />

Few things has influenced modern architecture, arts and design like the Bauhaus school in Germany. Opened by Walter Gropius in 1919 in Weimar (image is of the Bauhaus complex in Dessau), the Bauhaus school took a modernist approach to the unification of arts and craft.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_course.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_course.jpg" />

The basic motto of the Bauhaus was _form follows function_, which meant a focus on functional simplicity: 

> "Just as in the workshops of the Bauhaus the smallest utility object is given the simplest geometrical shape, so are these, the biggest of them all. Thus one is made to receive here the sense of a convincing uniformity of all objects made by man regardless of size, from a metal ashtray to a building" - Rudolf Arnheim

> "But the idea of freeing ourselves of tradition and of starting again from the two basic motives, the practical requirement of life and the conditions of the materials is so good that nothing else matters for the time being" - Rudolf Arnheim

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_gropius_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_gropius.jpg" />

The graphic products from the Bauhaus era are therefore closely tied to all other fields of art practiced at the Bauhaus. Nothing is used without a functional meaning, which led to an increased focus on grids and proportions. Color theory also played a major role in the Bauhaus foundation courses.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/kandinsky_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/kandinsky.jpg" />

Vassily Kandinsky
Geometric shapes in his painting - probably the best known - Guggenheim has a large collection of him.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/klee_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/klee.jpg" />

Paul Klee is mostly considered a painter, but released numerous essays design (Writings on Form and Design Theory, called Paul Klees notebook in english), which underlines the Bauhaus philospohy of combinaton of art and craft.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/nagy_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/nagy.jpg" />

Johannes Itten was one of the forces behind the foundation courses at the Bauhaus. He is mostly know for his work in color theory. On the more personal side he was a follower of the Christian fire cult Mazdaznan, in which the members follow a strict vegetarian diet, perform rhytmic breathing and gymnastic exercises - and the students at the Bauhaus were clearly divided into followers and not-followers of Itten.

Itten is mostly know for his book _The Art of Color_
TODO: What was essential in that book?
Color experiments - 
Color like music

Josef Albers
- a student of Ittem

Wrote _The Interaction of Color_
Simple geometric forms
(A few images of his work on black/white structures)
We're going to spend more time on Albers in the color class.

Both created a taxonomy of color 
We will talk more about these in our session about color theory

Both Albers and Moholy-Nagy was a part of the first modernist immigrants to the US, and they both had a profound impact on the new breed of American graphic designers in the golden age of advertising. Albers was appointed head of the graphic design department at Yale University, and Moholy-Nagy became head of the _New Bauhaus_ school on Chicago in 1937.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_poster_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_poster.jpg" />

All focused on color, geometric shapes - and after a poster also typography

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/nazi_designmanual.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/nazi_designmanual.jpg" />

Bauhaus closed abruptly in 1933 after intense pressure from the Nazi party. Considered _degenerate art_ by the leading Nazi politicians, Bauhaus modernism was replaced by art and architecture informed by classicist ideals. This newly found romantic realism was in architecture led by Hitler's chief architect Albert Speer. German art was as well dictated by the Nazi party, in particular Hitler and Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering (who at the end of WW2 had one of the biggest art collections known to man). In the coming years graphic design was heavily influenced by regime changes around the world.


Jan Tschichold
--------------

Inspired by the first Bauhaus Weimar exhibition, Jan Tschichold released _Die Neue Typografie_ in 1928. What today is considered an extreme modernist manifesto of typography, it had a profound impact on graphic design and typography at the time. In the book Tschichold condemned the use of serif fonts, as well as centered designs.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dieneue_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dieneue.jpg" />

Tschichold clashed with the Nazi regime and moved with his family to Switzerland. In the 1940's he relocated to London where he created the design manual for Penguin Books and helped design more than 500 of the famous Penguin paperback books.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/penguin_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/penguin.jpg" />

Here's an example of the 1930's Penguin Books paperback design, and Tschichold's revised version from the 1950's to the right.


Big Idea Designers
------------------

These european designers influenced a new generation of American designers, primarily centered around New York School of Advertising in the 50's and 60's. These so-called _Big Idea_ designers often relied on the creativity of the individual designer, introducing the idea of the artist into mainstream advertising. Characterized by a balance between simplicity and playfulness, these designers revolutionized the advertising industry, and invented a whole new way of reaching the consumer. This period is often called _the golden days_ of advertising, as glorified in the TV-series _Mad Men_.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/beetle2_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/beetle2.jpg" />

Originally designed by Ferdinand Porsche as a _people's car_ for the third Reich (on orders by Hitler), the Beetle was not an obvious success on the American market. The _Think Small_ campaign by Williams Bernbach with its heavy use of white-space, simplistic typography, and creative text copy, managed to build a strong relationship between the Beetle and American consumers.  

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/beetle_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/beetle.jpg" />

> "Let us prove to the world that good taste, good art, and good writing can be good selling." - William Bernbach

The Beetle campaign dared making fun of the Volkswagen brand. Also notice the use of "." at the end of short headings.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/paulrand_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/paulrand.jpg" />

**Paul Rand** is without doubt one of the most influential graphic designers in the history of the field. Although [often cited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand) as a proponent of the _Swiss Style_ of graphic design, Paul Rand's body of work has a notable degree of playfulness and artistic vision that cannot be found in the extremely systematic designs from his European colleagues. Rand is also known for his critique of graphic design education, including his departure as head of the Graphic Design department at Yale because of the acceptance of post-modern influences to the curriculum. I will not talk about post-modern graphic design in this class, but you can read more about it on ...

Paul Rand released numerous books (see _[Suggested Readings](/printing-code-2012#inspirational-reading)_), in which he often argued that graphic design, with its focus on color, form and proportion, should be considered as the basis for all visual arts.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bass_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bass.jpg" />

Another hugely important designer from this period is **Saul Bass**, who is best known for his movie poster designs.


The Swiss Style
---------------

> This graphic aesthetic and method was the second wave of European Modernism to influence the U.S. Essentially different from the "big idea" approach, it is based on an assumption of Modernist rational "method", a codified approach not so dependent on the individualistic inspiration and talent of the designer. - "American Graphic Design Expression", Katherine McCoy, 1990

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/brockmann_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/brockmann.jpg" />

The _Swiss Style_ is a term used to describe the new approach to graphic design that came from Switzerland in the 1960's. Centered around Josef Müller-Brockmann's "Grid Systems" and Karl Gerstner's "Designing Programmes" books, the _Swiss Style_ was a systematic methodology built around the concept of simple rules that stood in sharp contrast to the American _Big Idea_ style. 

<iframe width="560" height="338" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VDLPAE9wLEU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The _Swiss Style_ distilled graphic design into a series of simple constraints and rules. Use Helvetica. Use a grid system. It was a return to the purely functional graphic arts, in a way that it has been described as _Bauhaus applied_. The _Swiss Style_ had a profound impact on American corporations, as explained in this video from the movie _Helvetica_.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/brockmann2_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/brockmann2.jpg" />

**Josef Muller-Brockmann**'s book _Grid Systems_ suggested the use of strict grid systems to order graphic elements on the page. Gone where the artistic freedom of the artist:

> "The message will reach a maximum power of expression if the object or idea is presented aesthetically and efficiently with a minimum of accompanying design. Both subjective ornament in the sense of illustrative exaggerations and over-objective presentation must be avoided" - Josef Müller-Brockmann

Brockmann held to these rules in his own work to a degree that Michael Kroeger referred to Brockmann as _mechanical_ in [conversations with Paul Rand](http://amzn.to/gZHfWO).

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/gerstner_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/gerstner.jpg" />

In _Designing Programmes_, **Karl Gerstner** goes even further and proposes an approach to graphic design based on strict modular principles. As can be seen in the picture above, Gerstner often relies on rules that can be re-used to generate multiple versions of a graphic design. In this sense Gerstner's work is almost algorithimic, which was also mentioned in the press release when _Designing Programmes_ was re-released by Lars Müller in 2007:

> The book is especially topical and exciting in the context of current developments in computational design, which seem to hold out the possibility of programmed design.

Gerstner's work points directly to the notion of Serial Art, the early experiments in computational art, and projects like Donald Knuth's Metafont.

Serial Art
----------

> "The serial artist does not attempt to produce a beautiful or mysterious object but functions merely as a clerk cataloguing the results of his premise." - Sol Lewitt

> "The system is the work of art; the visual work of art is the proof of the system" - Sol Lewitt

Aspects of the serial art movement can be traced back to the 1930's, but it came into the publics eye during the 1960's with the emergence of artists like Karl Gerstner and Sol Lewitt. Central to the works of the serial artists is the concept of creating art through algorithms, although the computer was still not a toll of the artist.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/lewitt_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/lewitt.jpg" />

He is famous for creating the algorithm and letting his assistants perform it.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/lewitt_rules_hand.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/lewitt_rules_hand.jpg" />

Lewitt would create simple rules for the art piece, first by drawing all combinations by hand.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/lewitt_rules_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/lewitt_rules.jpg" />

Then translate it into a printed sheet of rules.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/lewitt_cubes_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/lewitt_cubes.jpg" />

Finally the rules would be translated into a sculpture or painting, mostly done by assistants. Lewitt's work is important to us in this class, not only because of the distinct graphic qualities in his work, but is also because it's built on an algorithmic process that is best performed by a computer. [Casey Reas has written a great text on Lewitt](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures/text.html) and software.


A Brief History of Computers
----------------------------

This is a good time to talk about computers. Everything happened at once. 

The first noteworthy computer design tool was built by Ivan Sutherland in 1963. It was called the Sketchpad, and it was a very early form of CAD drawing program. (use history from Form + Code p. 29)

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/sketchpad_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/sketchpad.jpg" />

Xerox PARC. PARC was a research center established in 1971 as a research division of the Xerox Corporation. It's widely famous for its contributions to computer science, which include the UI, the mouse, the laser printer, etc. 

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/xerox-beanbags_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/xerox-beanbags.jpg" />

Here is Douglas Englebart from Standford University (later PARC) introducing the computer mouse for the first time.

<iframe width="600" height="450" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1MPJZ6M52dI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Xerox PARC is not only important to use because of these innovations that changed the life of our generation, but also because they started to think about how a computer can be a useful tool for designers.... and they did an incredibly job. So incredible that most of their innovations stand untouched today. Look at the Xerox Start as an example:

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/xerox-star1_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/xerox-star1.jpg" />

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/xerox-star2_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/xerox-star2.jpg" />

Look at the attention to detail here. By not placing icons on top of the dark pixels in the background, icons get a much cleaner edge.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/xerox-star3_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/xerox-star3.jpg" />

That's infograhics for you!

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/googleui_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/googleui.jpg" />

Here's a comparison of interface design for Google Docs from the last 5 years, and the original UI for the Xerox Star from 1981. This should give you a sense of their accomplishments. It's also a worthwhile reminder that great design is a product of constraints.

The Xerox Parc creations proved to be insanely important, also because a 24-old Steve Jobs - who had frequented the Homebrew Computer Club at Standford - visit the PARC facilities and created some of the most important innovations for graphic designers.

> The Macintosh turned out so well because the people working on it were musicians, artists, poets and historians who also happened to be excellent computer scientists.
>
> _Steve Jobs_

<iframe width="600" height="450" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2B-XwPjn9YY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Some important but less known innovations of Steve Jobs is Postscript, a vector-like language that made it possible for the first time, to make your printed pages look exactly like what was on your computer, and hypercard, a UI-programming language for the early Machintosh computers.


The first computers in arts
---------------------------

Exactly like the Bauhaus, where machines became accessible to ordinary people, the computer slowly became accessible for artists. There are too many people to mention here, but here's a few important ones.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/nt1_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/nt1.jpg" />

The group known as the "New Tendencies" explored the used of the computer in the 1960's and 1970's in international exhibitions and the magazine "Bit International".

Here's a photo of a gathering in Paris in 1962.

Manuel Barbadilloin 1973.

"The Reponsive Eye" was an exhibition held at MoMa in 1965. It features some of the newest developments in so-called "Optic Art". Many of the artists used computers to create their artwork.

Second Generation Computational Artists
---------------------------------------

A second generation of artists started in the 1980's and 1990's. Common for all of them were a strong knowledge about, and focus on, the art of programming.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/maeda1_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/maeda1.jpg" />

John Maeda wrote the influential "Design by Numbers", "Creative Code" and "Maeda&Media" books. He was head of the MIT Aesthetics and Computation group, and a teacher for Processing creators Ben Fry and Casey Reas, plus ITP's own Jared Shiffman.

Mark Wilson is known for his experiments with plotter drawings. He received the Ars Electronica Grand Prize in 1992, and even though his earliest work was way before hom-computer-graphics, his style is very similar to the 1990's aesthetics of e.g. Karl Sims.

Karl Sims is known for his evolutionary graphic art (e.g. the Galapagos installation). He often used particle systems and artificial life in his computer programs to generate a final output. There's an interesting connection between Sol Lewitt's instructions and Karl Sims' software that chooses its on output.


The Internet and Design programs as Coding Environments
-------------------------------------------------------

Nothing has contributed more to the acceleration of new programming artists as the internet. With a bigger focus on graphics created on the computer, a series of coding environments (web-related or not) started appealing to designers who would otherwise not have thought of programming as a primary expression.

HTML!

Lingo and Adobe Director!

Even though it has a bad rep, Flash was hugely successful in luring in graphic designers. The notion of drawing objects and manipulating them in code (the displayobject and scene graph) was extremely powerful, and it has inspired a number of modern frameworks.

Books about Flash and Director started being published, only targeted towards designers.

... and of course Processing!


Today
------------

... and here we are today. It's impossible just to try and summarize how graphic artists use the computer today (other than to say that design and programming is intermingled), but here's a few notable projects.

There's Stefan Sagmeister, who we will be talking about in the "Logo" class.

Written Images Book


To sum up: It's important to me that you all know about this before diving into the assignments. Just because we're programming, it doesn't mean that we invent stuff. People have been working in the graphic arts for centuries, and it's important to know this stuff. We can bend the rules, but we cannot ignore them. And to bend them we must understand them.

Hopefully in this class you will learn to balance your visual creativity and your technical skills in a way so they optimize each other. That's a balance that I see very few people have in generative art. It's not about smudging the canvas with a repetition algorithm. It's about using the computer to what it's good for, and it's not necessarily placing a bunch of sh*t randomly across your canvas. Think!
