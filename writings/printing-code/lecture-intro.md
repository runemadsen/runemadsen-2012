The History of Graphic Design and Computational Form
====================================================

Graphic design is a relatively young way of expression, primarily a response to the communication needs of the industrial revolution. 

Early Renaissance
-----------------

Since the invention of movable type in the early 1400's, book design was a craft primarily focused on readability. Typography was neutral, and headings were very rare. Images were used sparingly and mostly for iconic purposes. A book was merely a medium for communicating spoken words. 


William Addison Dwiggins
------------------------

The invention of the term _Graphic Design_ has been attributed to William Addison Dwiggins, director of the Harvard University Press and founder of the Society of Calligraphers in Boston. Born in 1880 at the exact time of the invention of the Linotype machine, Dwiggins coined this term in 1922 to describe his process of designing books, as combination of typesetting, illustration and design. Book design changed from being a simple, neutral craft to a interpretive art:

> What type does the architect of advertising elect to use, and why? That question is the acolyte’s invariable first prayer for enlightenment—phrased always in one of the various voices of despair—what type shall I use? The gods refuse an answer. They refuse (sacrilege though it be to say it) because they do not know.

This - one of many book covers designed by Dwiggins - underlines this new way of thinking: That _seeing_ is as important as _reading_, and that typography and illustration can be used for symbolism. Dwiggins worked most of his life in advertising, and released the book _Layout in Advertising_ in 1928.


Futurists, Dadaists and De Stijl
--------------------------------

At the same time in the early 20th century quite a few artistic movements started rejecting the former divide between high art and every day design. The most important of these were the Futurists, Dadaists and De Stijl. With these movements came a very strong reinvention of graphic form.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/depero_futurista_cover_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/depero_futurista_cover.jpg" />

With the **Futurist Manifesto**, a number of Italian artists swore off the traditional arts, and instead sought to visualize the future, technology and the industrial revolution through the lens of most artistic expressions. In the graphic arts this meant experiments in typography, geometric forms and color. 

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/futurismo_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/futurismo.jpg" />

The futurist movement had strong ties to Fascism and Mussolini, which meant a further popularization of the futurist art through newspaper and poster design. 

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dada_show_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dada_show.jpg" />

**Dadaism** was an art movement that started as a reaction to the first world war. They borrowed heavily from the experimental typography of the Futurists, although their style was more surreal. They rebelled against any logic in the arts, to the degree that their work can seem almost post-modern today. In the graphic arts they combined expressive typography and extreme use of white-space with the heavy use of photo montages. The typeface itself held as much symbolism as the words it spelled out. Here it is a poster for the international Dadaist show in 1921.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dada_blume_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/dada_blume.jpg" />

Here it's the cover for Kurt Schwitters "Anna Blume" from 1919.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/mondrian_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/mondrian.jpg" />

**De Stijl**, or _The Style_ in Dutch, was an abstract art movement formed in the Netherlands. With its strict minimalism, De Stijl artists kept to a bare minimum of expression, rarely using anything other than straight lines and primary colors. Here it is the famous painter Piet Mondrian, one of the leading figures in the De Stijl movement.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/destijl_logo_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/destijl_logo.jpg" />

The important thing to notice, here with the original logo for the De Stijl publication, is the almost algorithmic use of form and proportion. It's a use of form and color that points towards the later works of Sol Lewitt, and even the early experiments in computational art.

All in all these movements made a drastic impact on the way typography, form and color was used in publications. It further diminished the former distinction between _high art_ and print design, and all three of these movements had a great impact on the teachings at the Bauhaus.


The Bauhaus
-----------


<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus.jpg" />

Few things has influenced modern architecture, arts and design like the Bauhaus school in Germany. Opened by Walter Gropius in 1919 in Weimar (image is of the Bauhaus complex in Dessau), the Bauhaus school took a modernist approach to the unification of arts and craft.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_course.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_course.jpg" />

The basic motto of the Bauhaus was _form follows function_, which meant a focus on functional simplicity: 

> "Just as in the workshops of the Bauhaus the smallest utility object is given the simplest geometrical shape, so are these, the biggest of them all. Thus one is made to receive here the sense of a convincing uniformity of all objects made by man regardless of size, from a metal ashtray to a building" - Rudolf Arnheim

> "But the idea of freeing ourselves of tradition and of starting again from the two basic motives, the practical requirement of life and the conditions of the materials is so good that nothing else matters for the time being" - Rudolf Arnheim

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_gropius_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/bauhaus_gropius.jpg" />

The graphic products from the Bauhaus era are therefore closely tied to all other fields of art practiced at the Bauhaus. Nothing is used without a functional meaning, which led to an increased focus on grids and proportions. Color theory also played a major role in the Bauhaus foundation courses.

Both Albers and Moholy-Nagy was a part of the first modernist immigrants to the US, and they both had a profound impact on the new breed of American graphic designers in the golden age of advertising. Albers was appointed head of the graphic design department at Yale University, and Moholy-Nagy became head of the _New Bauhaus_ school on Chicago in 1937.

All focused on color, geometric shapes - and after a poster (show poster: http://www.flickr.com/photos/35617001@N02/3297165580/in/set-72157614565413098/) - also typography

Bauhaus closed abruptly in 1933 after intense pressure from the Nazi party. Considered _degenerate art_ by the leading Nazi politicians, Bauhaus modernism was replaced by art and architecture informed by classicist ideals. This newly found romantic realism was in architecture led by Hitler's chief architect Albert Speer. German art was as well dictated by the Nazi party, in particular Hitler and Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering (who at the end of WW2 had one of the biggest art collections known to man). In the coming years graphic design was heavily influenced by regime changes around the world.


Jan Tschichold
--------------

Inspired by the first Bauhaus Weimar exhibition, Jan Tschichold released _Die Neue Typografie_ in 1928. What today is considered an extreme modernist manifesto of typography, it had a profound impact on graphic design and typography at the time. In the book Tschichold condemned the use of serif fonts, as well as centered designs.

Tschichold clashed with the Nazi regime and moved with his family to Switzerland. In the 1940's he relocated to London where he created the design manual for Penguin Books and helped design more than 500 of the famous Penguin paperback books.

Here's an example of the 1930's Penguin Books paperback design, and Tschichold's revised version from the 1950's to the right.


New York School of Advertising
------------------------------

SAUL BASS?
Sol LeWitt?

These european designers influenced a new generation of American designers, primarily centered around New York School of Advertising in the 50's and 60's. These so-called _Big Idea_ designers often relied on the creativity of the individual designer, introducing the idea of the artist into mainstream advertising. Characterized by a balance between simplicity and playfulness, these designers revolutionized the advertising industry, and invented a whole new way of reaching the consumer. This period is often called _the golden days_ of advertising, as glorified in the TV-series _Mad Men_.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/beetle2_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/beetle2.jpg" />

Originally designed by Ferdinand Porsche as a _people's car_ for the third Reich (on orders by Hitler), the Beetle was not an obvious success on the American market. The _Think Small_ campaign by Williams Bernbach with its heavy use of white-space, simplistic typography, and creative text copy, managed to build a strong relationship between the Beetle and American consumers.  

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/beetle_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/beetle.jpg" />

> "Let us prove to the world that good taste, good art, and good writing can be good selling." - William Bernbach

The Beetle campaign dared making fun of the Volkswagen brand. Also notice the use of "." at the end of short headings.

**Paul Rand** is without doubt one of the most influential graphic designers in the history of the field. Although [often cited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand) as a proponent of the _Swiss Style_ of graphic design, Paul Rand's body of work has a notable degree of playfulness and artistic vision that cannot be found in the extremely systematic designs from his European colleagues. Rand is also known for his critique of graphic design education, including his departure as head of the Graphic Design department at Yale because of the acceptance of post-modern influences to the curriculum. I will not talk about post-modern graphic design in this class, but you can read more about it on ...

Paul Rand released numerous books (see _[Suggested Readings](/printing-code-2012#inspirational-reading)_), in which he often argued that graphic design, with its focus on color, form and proportion, should be considered as the basis for all visual arts.


The Swiss Style
---------------

> This graphic aesthetic and method was the second wave of European Modernism to influence the U.S. Essentially different from the "big idea" approach, it is based on an assumption of Modernist rational "method", a codified approach not so dependent on the individualistic inspiration and talent of the designer. - "American Graphic Design Expression", Katherine McCoy, 1990

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/brockmann_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/brockmann.jpg" />

The _Swiss Style_ is a term used to describe the new approach to graphic design that came from Switzerland in the 1960's. Centered around Josef Müller-Brockmann's "Grid Systems" and Karl Gerstner's "Designing Programmes" books, the _Swiss Style_ was a systematic methodology built around the concept of simple rules that stood in sharp contrast to the American _Big Idea_ style. 

<iframe width="560" height="338" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VDLPAE9wLEU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The _Swiss Style_ distilled graphic design into a series of simple constraints and rules. Use Helvetica. Use a grid system. It was a return to the purely functional graphic arts, in a way that it has been described as _Bauhaus applied_. The _Swiss Style_ had a profound impact on American corporations, as explained in this video from the movie _Helvetica_.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/brockmann2_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/brockmann2.jpg" />

**Josef Muller-Brockmann**'s book _Grid Systems_ suggested the use of strict grid systems to order graphic elements on the page. Gone where the artistic freedom of the artist:

> "The message will reach a maximum power of expression if the object or idea is presented aesthetically and efficiently with a minimum of accompanying design. Both subjective ornament in the sense of illustrative exaggerations and over-objective presentation must be avoided" - Josef Müller-Brockmann

Brockmann held to these rules in his own work to a degree that Michael Kroeger referred to Brockmann as _mechanical_ in [conversations with Paul Rand](http://amzn.to/gZHfWO).

Exactly like the Bauhaus where machines became accessible to ordinary people, the computer became accessible for artists

Wassilly Kandisky expressed great interest in distilling art into algorithmic and geometrical figures, essentially art becoming math: "The final abstract expression of every art is number"

\= It's the same as before: Playing with form and color. The form is different. It's bits. But nothing else has changed.

Sum up: Graphic Design today is built on the entire history. to understand design today, you have to understand the computer (255 for color). We can bend the rules, but we cannot ignore them. And to bend them we must understand them.
