The History of Graphic Design and Computational Form
====================================================

Graphic design is a relatively young way of expression, primarily a response to the communication needs of the industrial revolution. 

## Early Renaissance

Since the invention of movable type in the early 1400's, book design was a craft primarily focused on readability. Typography was neutral, and headings were very rare. Images were used sparingly and mostly for iconic purposes. A book was merely a medium for communicating spoken words. 

## William Addison Dwiggins

The invention of the term _Graphic Design_ has been attributed to William Addison Dwiggins, director of the Harvard University Press and founder of the Society of Calligraphers in Boston. Born in 1880 at the exact time of the invention of the Linotype machine, Dwiggins coined this term in 1922 to describe his process of designing books, as combination of typesetting, illustration and design. Book design changed from being a simple, neutral craft to a interpretive art:

> What type does the architect of advertising elect to use, and why? That question is the acolyte’s invariable first prayer for enlightenment—phrased always in one of the various voices of despair—what type shall I use? The gods refuse an answer. They refuse (sacrilege though it be to say it) because they do not know.

This - one of many book covers designed by Dwiggins - underlines this new way of thinking: That _seeing_ is as important as _reading_, and that typography and illustration can be used for symbolism. Dwiggins worked most of his life in advertising, and released the book _Layout in Advertising_ in 1928.


## Futurists, Dadaists and De Stijl

At the same time in the early 20th century quite a few artistic movements started rejecting the former divide between high art and every day design. The most important of these were the Futurists, Dadaists and De Stijl. With these movements came a very strong reinvention of graphic form.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/depero_futurista_cover_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/depero_futurista_cover.jpg" />

With the **Futurist Manifesto**, a number of Italian artists swore off the traditional arts, and instead sought to visualize the future, technology and the industrial revolution through the lens of most artistic expressions. In the graphic arts this meant experiments in typography, geometric forms and color. 

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/futurismo_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/futurismo.jpg" />

The futurist movement had strong ties to Fascism and Mussolini, which meant a further popularization of the futurist art through newspaper and poster design.

**Dadaism** was an art movement that started as a reaction to the first world war. They borrowed heavily from the experimental typography of the Futurists, although their style was more surreal. They rebelled against any logic in the arts, to the degree that their work can seem almost post-modern today. In the graphic arts they combined expressive typography and extreme use of white-space with the heavy use of photo montages. The typeface itself held as much symbolism as the words it spelled out. Here it is a poster for the international Dadaist show in 1921.

Here it's the cover for Kurt Schwitters "Anna Blume" from 1919.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/mondrian_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/mondrian.jpg" />

**De Stijl**, or _The Style_ in Dutch, was an abstract art movement formed in the Netherlands. With its strict minimalism, De Stijl artists kept to a bare minimum of expression, rarely using anything other than straight lines and primary colors.

<img src="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/destijl_logo_small.jpg" data-slideshow="http://runemadsen-2012.s3.amazonaws.com/printing-code-2012/intro/destijl_logo.jpg" />

The important thing to notice, here with the original logo for the De Stijl publication, is the almost algorithmic use of form and proportion. It's a use of form and color that points towards the later works of Sol Lewitt, and even the early experiments in computational art.

All in all these movements made a drastic impact on the way typography, form and color was used in publications. It further diminished the former distinction between _high art_ and print design, and all three of these movements had a great impact on the teachings at the Bauhaus.


## The Bauhaus

Opened by Walter Gropius in 1919 in Weimar (show bauhaus building)

Foundation Courses (inspired ITP): http://www.gardenvisit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/image001.jpg

One of the most important movements in architecture, arts and design. The Bauhaus unified art and crafts

Tools from the industrial revolution became available to everyone. Parallel to how programming is now available to everyone.

Modernism: Uniformity of all objects made by man - no matter the size. As big as a house and as small as a spoon (show house and spoon)

> But the idea of freeing ourselves of tradition and of starting again from the two basic motives, the practical requirement of life and the conditions of the materials is so good that nothing else matters for the time being" - Rudolf Arnheim

For graphic design, these _Masters_ made a great difference

Vassily Kandinsky
Geometric shapes in his painting - probably the most well known.

Paul Klee

Josef Albers
Wrote _The Interaction of Color_
Simple geometric forms
(A few images of his work on black/white structures)

Johannes Itten (Not a Master)
Wrote _The Art of Color_
Itten himself was a follower of the Christian fire cult Mazdaznan, in which the members follow a strict vegetarian diet, perform rhytmic breathing and gymnastic exercises.
Color experiments - 
Color like music

Moholy-Nagy
Replaced Itten as a teacher in the foundation courses.
Painter geometric forms
(Insert pictures on google images)

Both created a taxonomy of color 
We will talk more about these in our session about color theory

All focused on color, geometric shapes - and after a poster (show poster: http://www.flickr.com/photos/35617001@N02/3297165580/in/set-72157614565413098/) - also typography

Bauhaus closed in 1933 after pressure from the Nazis (they called it degenerate art)


## Jan Tschichold

This was the same year 1928 as Jan Tschichold released _Die Neue Typografie_, inspired by the first Bauhaus Weimar exhibition [talk about how this book changed fonts. Talk about Jan Tschichold]

Very modernist: Condemned the use of serifs and centered design

Clashed with the Nazi regime and moved to Switzerland

Relocated to London in the 1940's where he created the design manual for Penguin Books.



## Germany and the USSR

Graphic design heavily influenced by regime changes around the world: Germany and USSR in the late 20's - 30's.


## Modernist Immigrants

First generation of modernist immigrants: Moholy-Nagy and Albers (Albers became the head of graphic design at Yale). This had a massive impact on public graphics: from text heavy to simplistic, modernist expressions (show coca cola before and after).


## The Big Idea

These european designers influenced a new generation of American designers: PAUL RAND (a lot about Paul Rand). Matured during the 50's. Centered in New York. The "Big Idea" men (explain why). All associated with New York School of Advertising. Show Bernbach's Volkswagen Ads, also NYSA. Bernbach broke traditional rules and made advertising art: For Avis: "We're No. 2. We Try Harder". Poking fun of the brand. This was also where the "." in end of headlines started.

SAUL BASS


## The Swiss Style

In the 1960's came the Swiss Style, influenced by Graphis and "Bibles" by Josef Muller-Brockmann and Karl Gerstner. Systematic methology in contrast to "Big Idea". This had a huge impact on America Corporations. (Explain, examples). Grids and typographic relationships. The relatively new field of Semiotics had a huge impact. It was Bauhaus applied.

Josef Muller-Brockmann

Karl Gerstner

Sol LeWitt


## Post-Modernism

1970's: Graphic design discovered it has a history. "Post-modernism". Venturi. Meta in graphic design. Humor. Mocking history. BASEL SCHOOL (Kunstbewergeschule) WAS THE IMPORTANT THING. This was post-modernism or "new wave". They began to ignore the grid. Visual complexity. No more obedient delivery of the client message.

## Xerox Parc

Sketchpad, Donald Sutherland
Donald Knuth
First computers were interested in typesetting: Major triumph for graphic design
Xerox Star: Inventing the UI (vs. google docs)

## The first computers in arts

Exactly like the Bauhaus where machines became accessible to ordinary people, the computer became accessible for artists

Wassilly Kandisky expressed great interest in distilling art into algorithmic and geometrical figures, essentially art becoming math: "The final abstract expression of every art is number"

The New Tendencies -> The Responsive Eye at MoMa

## Second Generation Artists

John Maeda - Aesthetics and Computation Group, MIT (Use projects from “Creative Code”)
Mark Wilson - http://mgwilson.com/
Karl Sims - http://www.karlsims.com/

## The Internet

Explosion in graphics programming
HTML and CSS

## Design programs as coding environments

## Today

Projects from Generative Gestaltung
Eric Mika’s project
\= It's the same as before: Playing with form and color. The form is different. It's bits. But nothing else has changed.

Sum up: Graphic Design today is built on the entire history. to understand design today, you have to understand the computer (255 for color). We can bend the rules, but we cannot ignore them. And to bend them we must understand them.
