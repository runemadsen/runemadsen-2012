The History of Graphic Design and Computational Form
====================================================

Graphic design is a relatively young way of expression, primarily a response to the communication needs of the industrial revolution. 

## William Addison Dwiggins

The word itself was first used by William Addison Dwiggins in 1928, to describe his own diverse practice of book, type, lettering and advertising design.

Rooted in European typesetting - moveable type in the renaissance - typesetting was a craft and primarily focused on readability. Not interpretive. If images were used, it was for iconic purposes. Symbolic imagery had its place in the "high arts". New way of thinking:  _seeing_ is as important as _reading_.


## Futurists, Dadaists and De Stijl

It was not until the early 20th century that typography was used with symbolic meaning. Futurists, Dadaist and De Stijl rejected the divide between "high art". They added symbolism to typography and functionalism to art. (show examples of these)


## The Bauhaus

Opened by Walter Gropius in 1919 in Weimar (show bauhaus building)

Foundation Courses (inspired ITP): http://www.gardenvisit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/image001.jpg

One of the most important movements in architecture, arts and design. The Bauhaus unified art and crafts

Tools from the industrial revolution became available to everyone. Parallel to how programming is now available to everyone.

Modernism: Uniformity of all objects made by man - no matter the size. As big as a house and as small as a spoon (show house and spoon)

> But the idea of freeing ourselves of tradition and of starting again from the two basic motives, the practical requirement of life and the conditions of the materials is so good that nothing else matters for the time being" - Rudolf Arnheim

For graphic design, these _Masters_ made a great difference

Vassily Kandinsky
Geometric shapes in his painting - probably the most well known.

Paul Klee

Josef Albers
Wrote _The Interaction of Color_
Simple geometric forms
(A few images of his work on black/white structures)

Johannes Itten (Not a Master)
Wrote _The Art of Color_
Itten himself was a follower of the Christian fire cult Mazdaznan, in which the members follow a strict vegetarian diet, perform rhytmic breathing and gymnastic exercises.
Color experiments - 
Color like music

Moholy-Nagy
Replaced Itten as a teacher in the foundation courses.
Painter geometric forms
(Insert pictures on google images)

Both created a taxonomy of color 
We will talk more about these in our session about color theory

All focused on color, geometric shapes - and after a poster (show poster: http://www.flickr.com/photos/35617001@N02/3297165580/in/set-72157614565413098/) - also typography

Bauhaus closed in 1933 after pressure from the Nazis (they called it degenerate art)


## Jan Tschichold

This was the same year 1928 as Jan Tschichold released _Die Neue Typografie_, inspired by the first Bauhaus Weimar exhibition [talk about how this book changed fonts. Talk about Jan Tschichold]

Very modernist: Condemned the use of serifs and centered design

Clashed with the Nazi regime and moved to Switzerland

Relocated to London in the 1940's where he created the design manual for Penguin Books.



## Germany and the USSR

Graphic design heavily influenced by regime changes around the world: Germany and USSR in the late 20's - 30's.


## Modernist Immigrants

First generation of modernist immigrants: Moholy-Nagy and Albers (Albers became the head of graphic design at Yale). This had a massive impact on public graphics: from text heavy to simplistic, modernist expressions (show coca cola before and after).


## The Big Idea

These european designers influenced a new generation of American designers: PAUL RAND (a lot about Paul Rand). Matured during the 50's. Centered in New York. The "Big Idea" men (explain why). All associated with New York School of Advertising. Show Bernbach's Volkswagen Ads, also NYSA. Bernbach broke traditional rules and made advertising art: For Avis: "We're No. 2. We Try Harder". Poking fun of the brand. This was also where the "." in end of headlines started.


## The Swiss Style

In the 1960's came the Swiss Style, influenced by Graphis and "Bibles" by Josef Muller-Brockmann and Karl Gerstner. Systematic methology in contrast to "Big Idea". This had a huge impact on America Corporations. (Explain, examples). Grids and typographic relationships. The relatively new field of Semiotics had a huge impact. It was Bauhaus applied.

Karl Gerstner

Sol LeWitt


## Post-Modernism

1970's: Graphic design discovered it has a history. "Post-modernism". Venturi. Meta in graphic design. Humor. Mocking history. BASEL SCHOOL (Kunstbewergeschule) WAS THE IMPORTANT THING. This was post-modernism or "new wave". They began to ignore the grid. Visual complexity. No more obedient delivery of the client message.

\= It's the same as before: Playing with form and color. The form is different. It's bits. But nothing else has changed.

Sum up: Graphic Design today is built on the entire history. to understand design today, you have to understand the computer (255 for color). We can bend the rules, but we cannot ignore them. And to bend them we must understand them.
