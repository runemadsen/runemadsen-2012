The woman in the red dress is a character in a training program built by the rebels in the Matrix. More specifically, [_Mouse_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Matrix_series#Mouse) designed her... and he picked the color red for her dress. Although many find it hard to work creatively with color, very few people would question why he chose this. It's attractive, erotic, wild and draws attention.

There are 2 reasons why I choose to show this scene:

1. The use of color in this movie is fantastic. A vague green color is used for all scenes in the Matrix. The captives are dressed in gray. Scenes in the Nebuchadnezzar are tinted blue to symbolize clouds, heaven and light. Everything has a symbolic meaning.

2. Once you learn to control color, you'll be like Neo moving through the Matrix. You'll see things that no one else sees.

I've had an obsession with color for many years. I find it to be one the hardest things to master in the graphic arts, as it's both very subjective and highly dynamic (our perception of a single color change depending on what other colors we pair it with).

So how do you go about finding color matches that express meaning?
