Open up with Andy Warhol eating a cheeseburger?
Open up with fun Paul Rand quote about computers? (p. 44)
Open up with quote: “Beauty is a function, after all, of any relevant visual message. Just as prose can be dull and straight-forward or well edited and lyrical, so too can a utilitarian object be designed to be more than just simply what it is” (into, design elements)

About the class
Inersection of graphic design and programming
Use code to create visuals
History of graphic design is a war between purely mathematical procedure (swiss) and big ideas
With the computer: tool dictates the result (photoshop). what happens when you create your own?
I urge you to use your assignments to create things for people: record covers, etc.


This is going to be a lot of work
No laptops
I expect lively discussions. I expect to learn.
I expect you to do the readings. I will point you out. This is a graduate program.
In this class I highly encourage you to take on the role as an artist and independent thinker: This means that you will need to find a delicate balance between thought and tool.
For the first class, book time in pairs at AMS. It’s not hard, but you will learn better.
Nobody knows exactly what’s going on with the creative coding movement, so I won’t try to give you a sense of that I know what all of this is - but we’re exploring.
Not sure where to distinguish between algorithmic art and graphic design.

Syllabus walk-though

Quick Introductions
Who are you? What’s your programming skills? What’s your design skills?

Reading Discussion
Talk about why the reading is important to the class. This doesn’t need to be a full discussion.

Hackers and Painters:
Touch on the idea of “programming as you go”. [Embrace failure](https://twitter.com/#!/runemadsen/status/192300820727996416/photo/1), but THINK!
Did you understand his idea of static typing? (We are using Java, a static typed language)
What did it mean to you what he said about learning by reading source code? (this is what we will do in this class)
Talk about DaVinci painting leaves: Relentlessness!

Lecture: The History of Graphic Design, Computational Form, and Everything In Between

Use [Golan Levins course list of artists](http://www.golancourses.net/2012spring/lectures/lecture-02-14/)
This talk should be sectioned into 3 things:
1) What is graphic design? (like mark hansen slides - explain the basics)
2) What is computation?
3) Where does it intersect? (why 255, etc. Show works of people in the intersection)
THIS SHOULD BE BUILD ON MY MICA TALK

Generative Gestaltung - take a ton of project examples
Eric Mika’s project
Flight Patterns: In data rep this is interesting because of the underlying data. It shapes the data and tells us something about transportation. In this class, however, we care about it for its aesthetic beauty. That’s the difference.

Take stuff from my Mica lecture about bits and 255 photoshop values - to understand design today, you have to understand the computer.

Use from Mica talk: My first experience with visual form was strictly computational. Then when the thing about the history of computation comes, go deep into that. Basically take my talk, pull some of my own work out of it, and put a lot of history into it.

Another point is that there’s something algorithmic about the design process. Especially when doing prints: The golden ratio and other composition techniques are basically math. So is color theory. What happens when we turn that knowledge into code? What happens when we let it spin out of control?

Technical Lecture: 
How to use the processing framework
Using Git
Handing in assignments with pull requests (students fork the repo, develop in their local repo, and submit pull requests)
Preparing for print (borders, color profile, etc)
The printers at AMS (you need to go there every week. Book a time. Won’t take you more than an hour each week).

Readings for this class:

Some readings about form

Assignment

Install Git and read about Git
Fork the repo, add a folder with a text file in it
