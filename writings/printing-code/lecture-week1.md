The History of Graphic Design, Computational Form, and Everything In Between
============================================================================

Graphic design is a relatively young way of expression, primarily a response to the communication needs of the industrial revolution.



Use [Golan Levins course list of artists](http://www.golancourses.net/2012spring/lectures/lecture-02-14/)
This talk should be sectioned into 3 things:
1) What is graphic design? (like mark hansen slides - explain the basics)
2) What is computation?
3) Where does it intersect? (why 255, etc. Show works of people in the intersection)
THIS SHOULD BE BUILD ON MY MICA TALK

Flight Patterns: In data rep this is interesting because of the underlying data. It shapes the data and tells us something about transportation. In this class, however, we care about it for its aesthetic beauty. That’s the difference.

Take stuff from my Mica lecture about bits and 255 photoshop values - to understand design today, you have to understand the computer.

Use from Mica talk: My first experience with visual form was strictly computational. Then when the thing about the history of computation comes, go deep into that. Basically take my talk, pull some of my own work out of it, and put a lot of history into it.

Another point is that there’s something algorithmic about the design process. Especially when doing prints: The golden ratio and other composition techniques are basically math. So is color theory. What happens when we turn that knowledge into code? What happens when we let it spin out of control?
