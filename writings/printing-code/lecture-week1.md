The History of Graphic Design, Computational Form, and Everything In Between
============================================================================

Graphic design is a relatively young way of expression, primarily a response to the communication needs of the industrial revolution. The word itself was first used by William Addison Dwiggins in 1928, to describe his own diverse practice of book, type, lettering and advertising design.

This was the same year as Jan Tschichold released _Die Neue Typografie_ [talk about how this book changed fonts. Talk about Jan Tschichold]

Rooted in European typesetting - moveable type in the renaissance - typesetting was a craft and primarily focused on readability. Not interpretive. If images were used, it was for iconic purposes. Symbolic imagery had its place in the "high arts".

It was not until the early 20th century that typography was used with symbolic meaning. Futurists, Dadaist and De Stijl rejected the divide between "high art". They added symbolism to typography and functionalism to art. (show examples of these)

Then along came the Bauhaus. (Talk about the Bauhaus). The Bauhaus unified art and crafts. Modernist approach to unite craft, design, art and business. Uniformity of all objects made by man - no matter the size. Tiny object gets the simples size. As do the biggest. "But the idea of freeing ourselves of tradition and of starting again from the two basic motives, the practical requirement of life and the conditions of the was materials is so good that nothing else matters for the time being" - Rudolf Arnheim. p. 226. Graphic Design History. (More Bauhaus)

All of this was build on the notion that _seeing_ is as important as _reading_.

Graphic design heavily influenced by regime changes around the world: Germany and USSR in the late 20's - 30's.

First generation of modernist immigrants: Bayer, Sutnar, Moholy-Nagy and Matter. This had a massive impact on public graphics: from text heavy to simplistic, modernist expressions (show coca cola before and after).

These european designers influenced a new generation of American designers: PAUL RAND (a lot about Paul Rand). Matured during the 50's. Centered in New York. The "Big Idea" men (explain why). All associated with New York School of Advertising. Show Bernbach's Volkswagen Ads, also NYSA. Bernbach broke traditional rules and made advertising art: For Avis: "We're No. 2. We Try Harder". Poking fun of the brand. This was also where the "." in end of headlines started.

In the 1960's came the Swiss Style, influenced by Graphis and "Bibles" by Josef Muller-Brockmann and Karl Gerstner. Systematic methology in contrast to "Big Idea". This had a huge impact on America Corporations. (Explain, examples). Grids and typographic relationships. The relatively new field of Semiotics had a huge impact. It was Bauhaus applied.

1970's: Graphic design discovered it has a history. "Post-modernism". Venturi. Meta in graphic design. Humor. Mocking history. BASEL SCHOOL (Kunstbewergeschule) WAS THE IMPORTANT THING. This was post-modernism or "new wave". They began to ignore the grid. Visual complexity. No more obedient delivery of the client message.

Then switch to computational form






Use [Golan Levins course list of artists](http://www.golancourses.net/2012spring/lectures/lecture-02-14/)
This talk should be sectioned into 3 things:
1) What is graphic design? (like mark hansen slides - explain the basics)
2) What is computation?
3) Where does it intersect? (why 255, etc. Show works of people in the intersection)
THIS SHOULD BE BUILD ON MY MICA TALK

Flight Patterns: In data rep this is interesting because of the underlying data. It shapes the data and tells us something about transportation. In this class, however, we care about it for its aesthetic beauty. That’s the difference.

Take stuff from my Mica lecture about bits and 255 photoshop values - to understand design today, you have to understand the computer.

Use from Mica talk: My first experience with visual form was strictly computational. Then when the thing about the history of computation comes, go deep into that. Basically take my talk, pull some of my own work out of it, and put a lot of history into it.

Another point is that there’s something algorithmic about the design process. Especially when doing prints: The golden ratio and other composition techniques are basically math. So is color theory. What happens when we turn that knowledge into code? What happens when we let it spin out of control?
