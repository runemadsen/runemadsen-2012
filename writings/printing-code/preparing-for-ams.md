Preparing Images For Printing At AMS
====================================

Now that you know how to export PDF's from Processing, how do we prepare the image for print at AMS? It's a simple process, but it's important to do it right. These are the steps we need to take:

* Picking the paper
* Save as TIFF
* Convert to Adobe RGB (1998)


Picking the Paper
-----------------

Before you start coding, you need to figure out what kind of paper you want to print on. We have 2 types os paper:

### Ultrasmooth Fine Art

This is the **matte** paper, and you have to use the "Mac Print MK" printer for it. If the printer is booked you can also book the "Mac Print 4900" printer, but it will need some resetting. The paper is a rough, non-shiny type, and it works really well for graphic prints.

This paper is 17" wide, which means that your final image needs to be 5100 pixels wide. You basically determine the height, as it's a full roll of paper. Don't use too much though. Often you want the height to be less than 22", maybe even square.

We have 2 rolls of this paper.

### Premium Semimatte Photo Paper

This is the **photo** paper, and you have to use the "Mac Print A" or "Mac Print B" printers for it. The paper is not glossy, but looks more like photo paper.

This paper is 16" wide, which means that your final image needs to be 4800 pixels wide. Again, you determine the height.

We have 1 roll of this paper. Both of these rolls are in the ER with "MATTE" and "PHOTO" written on the boxes.


Save as PDF
-----------

Instead of saving a PNG or JPG from Processing, you will need to save it in PDF format. In order to optimize the colors for use on the AMS computer screens, we will need to convert the PDF into the Adobe RGB (1998) color profile. This makes sure that when you see your PDF on the screen at AMS, the colors will look the same on your print. DOn't trust your laptop screen.


Convert to Adobe RGB (1998)
---------------------------


You can use either Illustrator or Adobe Acrobat Pro to convert your PDF color profile. I'll show you how to do it in illustrator.

First open your PDF in illustrator and choose "Save as Copy"

Save the copy as a PDf.

In the settings dialog, choose "Output", choose "Adobe RGB (1998)" as the destination format. Make sure your dialog looks like the screenshot, and press "Save PDF".
