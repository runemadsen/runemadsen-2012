Midterm reviews
---------------

Everyone loves the class. A few notes:

- People should hang their prints before class, and we should walk around to see them
- More code. We do a lot of design, and code is more review
- Real design critique could start from week 1


Form

* Add the Paul Rand repetition and randomization stuff from my Waza talk!!!!

COLOR

* The HSBColor class is too confusing when showing the individual color themes. Just use variables.

Typography

* Add this: https://vimeo.com/24358631
* The typography class should have more about basic typography. Go through normal graphic design use of fonts, baseline designs, etc.
* There is so much damn functionality in Geomerative that can be explained. Scale, widht, height, etc, etc. We need to talk much more about that.

GRID

* More grid examples in the beginning of the lecture, to show how people use grid systems
* Add p. 142-148 as example in Grids class

LOGO

* Add reading from Dynamic Identities to logo class
* for logo class, use this generative logo (in the mid of video from roskilde: http://vimeo.com/27737392).

RANDOMIZATION

* THIS HAS NO FUCKING EXAMPLES!!!
* The class on vectors and randomization should have much more basics of pvector and the toxiclibs vector funcionality, that leads to spline 2D and all that stuff.

REPETITION

* Use this: https://code.google.com/p/fleen/

* Add my paul rand examples from talk


MOTION

* To motion class, add: Use “Simulate” chapter in Form and Code: Swarms, Genetic Algorithms, particles, so on.

TRANSFORMATION

* USE GEOMERATIVE SVG FUNCTIONS IN IMAGE CLASS: (HelloPolygonize from examples, etc)

3D

* for 3D class: Make sagmeister casa de musica logo in 3d model and make it choose a viewport to render
* In 3D class, use mesh

General

* All assignments after midterm should be based on real world design problems.
* Use Marcin Ignac examples (he's danish!) : http://marcinignac.com/, http://marcinignac.com/projects/category/featured/
* Change all examples so they don't use .hue() .saturation() and .brightness(), instead toHex()
