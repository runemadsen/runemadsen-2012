Form

* Form class should have ALL THE GEOMERATIVE FUNCTIONALITY. LOOK IN THE EXAMPLES!!!
* Much more about the toxiclibs form functions (Line2D, ray, Vectors).
* Use geomerative base classes (RPath, RShape) for form class (or later classes). Explain how the RPath works, and how multiple RPaths are in a RShape (maybe wait with some of this for the transformation class) 

COLOR

* Color class should be ALL in TColor!
* Make better example (JOEs example) with toxiclibs color theory

Typography

* The typography class should have more about basic typography. Go through normal graphic design use of fonts, baseline designs, etc.
* For font class, use more time on how the font is drawn on the screen. Then spend time on the Geomerative RFont and how to use the draw method with a PGraphics object. The students don't know how to draw fonts with geomerative.
* Use this talk: http://www.livestream.com/etsy/video?clipId=pla_3c805d93-1e45-4b2e-8380-84f59ef43a84

GRID

* More grid examples in the beginning of the lecture, to show how people use grid systems
* Add p. 142-148 as example in Grids class

LOGO

* Add reading from Dynamic Identities to logo class
* for logo class, use this generative logo (in the mid of video from roskilde: http://vimeo.com/27737392).

RANDOMIZATION

* The class on vectors and randomization should have much more basics of pvector and the toxiclibs vector funcionality, that leads to spline 2D and all that stuff.

REPETITION

* Repetition class should have example of doing a Tile class that you can put in x,y for loops in setup and create a tiling pattern.

MOTION

* To motion class, add: Use “Simulate” chapter in Form and Code: Swarms, Genetic Algorithms, particles, so on.

TRANSFORMATION

* USE GEOMERATIVE SVG FUNCTIONS IN IMAGE CLASS: (HelloPolygonize from examples, etc)

3D

* for 3D class: Make sagmeister casa de musica logo in 3d model and make it choose a viewport to render
* In 3D class, use mesh

General

* All assignments after midterm should be based on real world design problems.
* Use Marcin Ignac examples (he's danish!) : http://marcinignac.com/, http://marcinignac.com/projects/category/featured/
* Change all examples so they don't use .hue() .saturation() and .brightness(), instead toHex()
