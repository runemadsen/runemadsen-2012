* Form class could be two weeks, the second about how to build more complex forms, and ALL THE TOXICLIBS FORM/MESH FUNCTIONALITY!!!
* Explain PGraphics better. Students need to have a better understanding of how to scale stuff, etc.
* The typography class should have more about basic typography. Go through normal graphic design use of fonts, baseline designs, etc.
* For font class, use more time on how the font is drawn on the screen. Then spend time on the Geomerative RFont and how to use the draw method with a PGraphics object. The students don't know how to draw fonts with geomerative.
* All assignments after midterm should be based on real world design problems.
* Add p. 142-148 as example in Grids class
* Add reading from Dynamic Identities to logo class
* The class on vectors and randomization should have much more basics of pvector and the toxiclibs vector funcionality, that leads to spline 2D and all that stuff.

* for logo class, use this generative logo (in the mid of video from roskilde: http://vimeo.com/27737392).
* Use Marcin Ignac examples (he's danish!) : http://marcinignac.com/, http://marcinignac.com/projects/category/featured/
* In the beginning it should be much more about the toxiclibs form functions (Line2D, ray, Vectors). Maybe 2 weeks on form, and delete one of the other classes?
* Color class should be ALL in TColor!
* Repetition class should have example of doing a Tile class that you can put in x,y for loops in setup and create a tiling pattern.
