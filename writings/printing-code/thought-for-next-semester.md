* Form class could be two weeks, the second about how to build more complex forms, and ALL THE TOXICLIBS FORM/MESH FUNCTIONALITY!!!
* Explain PGraphics better. Students need to have a better understanding of how to scale stuff, etc.
* The typography class should have more about basic typography. Go through normal graphic design use of fonts, baseline designs, etc.
* For font class, use more time on how the font is drawn on the screen. Then spend time on the Geomerative RFont and how to use the draw method with a PGraphics object. The students don't know how to draw fonts with geomerative.
