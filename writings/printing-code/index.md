Printing Code 2012
==================

**Dislaimer: These pages are slides and notes for my lectures for this class. They are not by any means edited for clarity or proofread for mistakes.**

**Printing Code** is a graduate course taught at the Interactive Telecommunications Program during the fall 2012 semester. In this course students explore the use of computational techniques to produce physical prints, focusing on the intersection between graphic design and code. Class time will be divided between exploring design topics like colors, grids and typefaces, and applying these towards computational topics like randomization, repetition and generative form.

Weekly readings include relevant writings from the history of graphic design ([Josef Muller-Brockmann](http://bit.ly/KR2jkA), [Paul Rand](http://bit.ly/KzNyhy)), articles from the history of computation ([Vannevar Bush](http://bit.ly/9Zat9h), [Douglas Englebart](http://bit.ly/B4HDX)) and everything in between ([Sol Lewitt](http://bit.ly/BX1iy), [Edward Tufte](http://bit.ly/49i1Xj)).

Weekly homework can be produced using the digital printers at [NYU’s Advanced Media Studio](http://bit.ly/Krjjhh), however students are encouraged to utilize whatever physical printing techniques they prefer, that being stencils, letter press, silk screen, weaving or home-made printers.

The class aims not only to teach the students how to create physical prints via code, but also to have something interesting to say about it. The class requires ICM or similar programming background.

Introduction
------------

> It’s important to use your hands, this is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator - Paul Rand

For many years graphic design education has been a separate field. You learn about color, grids, form, balance, typography, and books on the subject are geared towards individuals with visual creativity. The opposite can be said about the field of programming that for a long time has been geared towards technically skilled people. During the last decade this line has obviously blurred, but not to the degree you would expect. Companies still hire _designers_ or _developers_. Most web design is still made in Photoshop and then translated into code. I even know quite a few creative coders who act like scared children when asked to design something.

For someone who grew up as a part of the computer generation, this divide might seem problematic. If your first experiments with color and form was when you were also writing HTML and CSS for the first time, then how do you know where design stops and programming begins? Graphic design and programming are so intermingled today that a term like *Computational Design* seems like a much better explanation of the two merging fields. [Design is how it works](http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs), not just a last layer of make-up.

As I've grown more experienced as a graphic designer, it has become obvious that a great deal of this experience is built on a very systematic approach to design. Graphic design almost seems like algorithms controlled by a creative vision. Grids are just basic measurements. Typography is all about spacing and curves. Color schemes are basic math performed on the color spectrum. This class is about investigating what happens when we start creating graphic art only by writing code. It's an experiment in replacing already exiting tools (that too long has dictated the visual look of computational design - hello drop shadow) with our own software programs. We will investigate graphic design systems, distill them into algorithms, and eventually let them spin out of control.


Week 1: Hello World
-------------------

> Beauty is a function, after all, of any relevant visual message. Just as prose can be dull and straight-forward or well edited and lyrical, so too can a utilitarian object be designed to be more than just simply what it is

>*Timothy Samara, Design Elements*

### Readings for this week

* [Software Structures](http://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures/text.html) by Casey Reas
* Something by Paul Rand from Design, Form and Chaos

### Class Overview

* Introductions

* [About the class](/printing-code-2012/about-the-class)

* [Reading Discussion](/printing-code-2012/readings-questions) (if we have time)

* Lecture: **[The History of Graphic Design and Computational Form](/printing-code-2012/lecture-intro)**

* [Using Processing to create graphic prints](/printing-code-2012/using-processing-to-create-graphic-prints)

### Assignment for next week

* Print something on the school's laser printer. A4. This means only grayscale. Using one variable?


Week 2: Form
------------

> Without aesthetic, design is either the humdrum repetition of familiar cliches or a wild scramble for novelty. Without the aesthetic, the computer is but a mindless speed machine, producing effects without substance. Form without relevant content, or content without meaningful form.

> Paul Rand

### Readings for this week

### Class Overview

* [Reading Discussion](/printing-code-2012/readings-questions)

* Homework design critique

* Lecture: [Computational Form and Format](/printing-code-2012/lecture-form)

* Trip to AMS to see the printers

### Assignment for next week

* Using the [Processing framework](#link-to-github-repo) I showed in class, write code that outputs 3 different shapes aligned from top to bottom: POSSIBLE: Wet, sharp, chaos, beauty, thunder. Use only black and white. Print on a poster at AMS and bring to class for design critique. MAYBE USE ONLY FOR LOOPS, IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM DO GENERATIVE.

Week 5: Grids
-------------

> A grid system is not just a set of rules to follow... but it's also a set of rules to play off of–to break, even. Given the right grid – the right system of constraints – very good designers can create solutions that are both orderly and unexpected
