Printing Code 2012
==================

In this course students explore the use of computational techniques to produce physical prints, focusing on the intersection between graphic design and code. Class time will be divided between exploring design topics like colors, grids and typefaces, and applying these towards computational topics like randomization, repetition and generative form.

Weekly readings include relevant writings from the history of graphic design ([Josef Muller-Brockmann](http://bit.ly/KR2jkA), [Paul Rand](http://bit.ly/KzNyhy)), articles from the history of computation ([Vannevar Bush](http://bit.ly/9Zat9h), [Douglas Englebart](http://bit.ly/B4HDX)) and everything in between ([Sol Lewitt](http://bit.ly/BX1iy), [Edward Tufte](http://bit.ly/49i1Xj)).

Weekly homework can be produced using the digital printers at [NYU’s Advanced Media Studio](http://bit.ly/Krjjhh), however students are encouraged to utilize whatever physical printing techniques they prefer, that being stencils, letter press, silk screen, weaving or home-made printers.

The class aims not only to teach the students how to create physical prints via code, but also to have something interesting to say about it. The class requires ICM or similar programming background.

Introduction
------------

> It’s important to use your hands, this is what distinguishes you from a cow or a computer operator - Paul Rand

For many years graphic design education has been a separate field. You learn about color, grids, form, balance, typography, and the learning material on the subject is minded towards individuals with visual creativity. The opposite can be said about the field of programming, where the material for a long time has been geared towards technically skilled people. During the last decade this line has obviously blurred, but not to the degree you would expect. Companies still hire _designers_ or _developers_. Most web design is still made in Photoshop and then translated into code. I know quite a few creative coders who acts like scared children when asked to _design_ something.

For people who grew up as a part of the computer generation this divide might seem problematic. These are the people who first experimented with color and form by writing HTML and CSS by hand. Where graphic [design is how it works](http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/walter_isaacson_steve_jobs), not just a last layer of make-up.

As you become a better graphic designer, it's obvious how much of graphic design could be distilled into algorithms. Grids are just basic measurements. Typography is all about spacing and curves. Choosing a color scheme is all about choosing an algorithmic approach to the color spectrum (one example is choosing a color scheme with equal distance in hues). This is where quotes from graphic design prophets start to break down, like the one above from Paul Rand.
