Dear Class,

I very much look forward to our first session this Thursday. “Printing Code” is a class where we will be working in the intersection between programming and graphic design. This means that you will need to bring both a desire to work hard on the programming assignments, and an interest in leading the in-class discussions around the weekly readings. This is a class about the art of computer programming, and we will treat “art” and “programming” equally.

[ This class is about investigating the outer edges of graphic design. To break the rules. As rules can be broken, but not ignored, we need to know the rules first - history and introduction to graphic design elements]
[ something about the class being focused on grasping fundamentals, and then spinning them out of control later ]


Here’s a few things to keep in mind...

This is a class where we present both code and product, and during presentations you will have to account for the code that produced your visual. Hopefully this will teach you a ton about programming, make you write clean code, and keep the “copy / paste / tweak” mentality away.

You will not need to have your laptops open in this class, as I will post slides and example code on the class webpage after every class. If you do wish to take notes on your laptop, please let me know.

Finally, here’s the link to the class website: www.runemadsen.com/printing-code-2012. You will find the syllabus and all other related material there.

As you can see on the syllabus, there’s a reading and an assignment to do before our first class. It won’t take you long. Please come prepared to show the results of the assignment, and to participate in a discussion about the reading.

See you soon.
