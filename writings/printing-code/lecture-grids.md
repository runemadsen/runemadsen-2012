WHAT IS A GRID SYSTEM?

EXAMPLE OF GRID SYSTEMS?

HOW WOULD YOU APPLY A GRID SYSTEM IN CODE?

The computer screen is already a grid system.

THEN SPIN OUT OF CONTROL
	
	Show code that uses 2 grid systems on top of each other (generate 2 grid objects with random values and place stuff)

It's all about measurements
Show sketch that has a very simple 2x3 grid system
Show sketch that has spacing between the grids
> They should all use simple getPosition() functions



THINGS TO USE

Use grid system text from Form and Code, p. 101.
This class should start with explanation of grids and then move on to talk about how to make this algorithmic and mess it up.
Talk about grids in polar coordinate systems. Use GG polar coordinate converter. What is a grid in polar coordinates?
Talk about gerstners [flexible grid](http://www.aisleone.net/2010/design/celebrating-karl-gerstner/) from “designing programmes”
Use Rand lecture book p. 27 illustration and write a sketch that does this with masks.
