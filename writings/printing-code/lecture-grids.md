WHAT IS A GRID SYSTEM?
----------------------

Show quick examples to be implemented with examples later
- Manuscript grid
- Column Grid
- Modular Grid
- Hierarchical Grid

== It's a thing we do to constrain the white page.

Coding a Grid
-------------

* Everything needs to be floats, otherwise the columns won't line up (show example)

Coding a Manuscript Grid
------------------------
Examples
Very simple Processing Code


Coding a Column Grid
--------------------
Examples
Show simple column grid processing program
Show generative placement column grid processing program
MAKE generative column widths grid processing program


Coding a Modular Grid
---------------------
Examples
Processing Code


Coding a Hierarchical Grid
--------------------------
Examples
Processing Code


Grid Deconstructions
--------------------

SHOW EXAMPLES!!!!

The computer screen is already a grid system.

THEN SPIN OUT OF CONTROL
	
	Show code that uses 2 grid systems on top of each other (generate 2 grid objects with random values and place stuff)

It's all about measurements
Show sketch that has a very simple 2x3 grid system
Show sketch that has spacing between the grids
> They should all use simple getPosition() functions

Make a grid where the columns randomly wary in width (but based on rules). apply content into them.



THINGS TO USE

Use DE p. 207: Write a Processing sketch that generates that type constellations.

Use grid system text from Form and Code, p. 101.
This class should start with explanation of grids and then move on to talk about how to make this algorithmic and mess it up.
Talk about grids in polar coordinate systems. Use GG polar coordinate converter. What is a grid in polar coordinates?
Talk about gerstners [flexible grid](http://www.aisleone.net/2010/design/celebrating-karl-gerstner/) from “designing programmes”
Use Rand lecture book p. 27 illustration and write a sketch that does this with masks.
