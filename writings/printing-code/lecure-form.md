On the most basic level we have space and form. Even at the most basic level, these forms mean something, and this week you'll be working with very simple forms. You will learn to generate simple forms via code, and learn to _see_ the meaning of their interaction.
	
	show first a white rectangle (space), and then a famous symbol in it (form)

First we choose a specific format.

	Rectangular
	Horizontal
	Vertical
	
Then we can put things it it

	Rectangle
	Circle
	Triangle

It matters where we place forms in space. A circle can seem lost in space

	show a tiny circle in the middle
	
... and dominant in space just by changing its placement.

	show a big circle in the middle
	
The same way a rectangle can lay dormant

	Show a horizontal rectangle
	
And become agitated by just changing its placement

	Show the same rectangle rotated
	
The placement and thickness of a single line can make a world of difference

	show example from form chapter in DE
	
Even with a single format and a single shape, you can create thousands of expressions to fit you communicative needs.

Some of these shapes have inherent algorithmic characteristics. Even Michelangelo will suffer defeat if competing with a computer in drawing a perfect circle. Changing the size of a circle in code is many times faster than doing it by hand.

Other shapes have inherent organic qualities, and are harder to replicate on a computer. You can draw a random line across a piece of paper in less than one second, but it will take much longer to code it.

This poses a series of questions: When working with computational form, should we prefer some shapes to other? How far should we go to simulate organic, human techniques in the digital world? Is it fake recreating pen pressure on a line, when the output is a pixel grid?

We can introduce more complexity by introducing more forms. Even with simple repetition, we can build complex scenarios. Repetition is banal when writing code. It is the distribution of the repeated elements that creates meaning.

	Now I need the grid of rectangles ported to Processing, changing small lines of code to change it.
