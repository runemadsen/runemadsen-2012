Communications Lab Web 2012
===========================

The web has become the most basic technology of interaction — between people and machines, people and data, and, most importantly, people and other people. Though the core web interaction is simple — a client sends a request to a server, which replies — services of incredible sophistication and scale have been built around it. In this class, students will learn to lay out a web page; make the page responsive to the user; embed a form for taking user input; and create a simple server to receive, store, manipulate, and return that input.

Communication Lab: Web will introduce you to three critical pieces of web infrastructure -- client, server, and data store -- and their interactions. A web client is a browser (or indeed any other web-aware tool) that gets data from (or sends data to) a web server on behalf of the user, as when your browser receives and renders a web page. The server is the software that receives and replies to requests from web clients. Data stores are ways for the server to gather and organize data in a way that persists between client requests, as when data you send to the server is stored for later use.

Students will build and use all three elements -- client, server, datastore -- using HTML+CSS, the design language of the web; Sinatra, a programming language specially designed for interactive web servers; DataMapper to store and manipulate data on the server.
